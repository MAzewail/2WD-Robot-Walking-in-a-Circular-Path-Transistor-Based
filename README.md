# 2WD-Robot-Walking-in-a-Circular-Path-Transistor-Based-
This project showcases a two-wheel drive (2WD) robot that walks in a circular path using transistors instead of a motor driver IC. By utilizing transistors as switches, you can control the movement of the robot's motors and make it walk in a circular trajectory.
