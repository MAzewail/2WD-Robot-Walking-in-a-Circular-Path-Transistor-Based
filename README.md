# 2WD Robot Walking in a Circular Path (Transistor-Based)

Welcome to the 2WD Robot Walking in a Circular Path (Transistor-Based) project! This project showcases a two-wheel drive (2WD) robot that walks in a circular path using transistors instead of a motor driver IC. By utilizing transistors as switches, you can control the movement of the robot's motors and make it walk in a circular trajectory.

## Project Overview

The 2WD Robot Walking in a Circular Path (Transistor-Based) project is designed to make a 2WD robot walk in a circular trajectory using transistors as switches. By controlling the transistors' states, you can control the movement of the robot's motors, causing it to move in a circular path.

## Features

- Two-wheel drive robot walking in a circular path.
- Transistors used as switches to control motor movement.
- Simple and cost-effective motor control solution.

## Hardware Requirements

To set up and run this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino or compatible microcontroller board.
- Two DC motors for the 2WD robot.
- NPN transistors (e.g., 2N2222, BC547, etc.) for motor control.
- Resistors for circuit connections.
- Jumper wires for circuit connections.
- Breadboard or PCB for assembling the circuit.
